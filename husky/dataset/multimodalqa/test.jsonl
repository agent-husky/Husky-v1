{"index": 4, "question": "The Derby is frequently referred to as \"The Run for the Roses,\" because a lush blanket of 554 red roses is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. The tradition originated in 1883 when New York socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post-Derby party that was attended by Churchill Downs founder and president, Col. M. Lewis Clark. This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race's official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner. The Governor of Kentucky awards the garland and the Kentucky Derby Trophy.

Initially a tropical storm, the system moved northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on October 22 and a major hurricane by October 23. Later that day, the cyclone peaked as a Category 4 on the modern day Saffir-Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane gradually curved northeastward and weakened to a Category 3 before making landfall near Tarpon Springs, Florida, late on October 25, becoming the first major hurricane to hit the area since a hurricane in 1848. The storm quickly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane while crossing Central Florida, before reaching the Atlantic Ocean early on the following day. Thereafter, system moved east-southeastward and remained fairly steady in intensity before weakening to a tropical storm late on October 29.

However, Kevin Costner had starred in Blake's only previous film, Stacy's Knights (1983), and encouraged Blake in early 1986 to turn the Western screenplay into a novel to improve its chances of being produced. The novel was rejected by numerous publishers but finally published in paperback in 1988. The rights were purchased by Costner, with an eye on directing it. Actual production lasted for four months, from July 18 to November 23, 1989. Most of the movie was filmed on location in South Dakota, mainly on private ranches near Pierre and Rapid City, with a few scenes filmed in Wyoming. Specific locations included the Badlands National Park, the Black Hills, the Sage Creek Wilderness Area, and the Belle Fourche River area.

{"index": 41, "question": "Selected 5th overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Miami Heat, Wade quickly emerged as a productive player on a youthful Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5% shooting with averages of 4.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists per game. Wade is one of only four Marquette University players to be drafted in the first round; his is the highest draft selection in school history. After a 5-15 start, the Heat would gradually improve and finish 42-40 to qualify for the NBA playoffs. He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs, particularly against the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the success of fellow rookies Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the 2004 NBA All-Rookie Team, and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony). He was ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played. In the playoffs Wade hit a game-winning shot in Game 1 of the Heat's first round series against the New Orleans Hornets.

{"index": 42, "question": "The 1992 NBA draft took place on June 24, 1992, in Portland, Oregon. At the time, the draft was considered to be one of the deepest drafts in NBA history. The top three picks (Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning, Christian Laettner) were considered can't-miss prospects. O'Neal and Mourning are Hall of Famers.  Laettner made one All-Star game in his career and was an Olympic Gold Medalist on the 1992 Dream Team, but did not live up to the lofty expectations set for him. All three would end up playing together on the 2005 Miami Heat. Two other players went on to become All-Stars (Tom Gugliotta once, Latrell Sprewell four times) and several others had solid careers (Jimmy Jackson, Robert Horry, Doug Christie, P.J. Brown, LaPhonso Ellis, Jon Barry, Walt Williams, Anthony Peeler, and Clarence Weatherspoon). Harold Miner, who was given the nickname \"Baby Jordan\" because of his similarities to Michael Jordan, slipped to number 12 and, other than winning two slam dunk contests, only had a brief, uneventful four-year career. Christian Donald Laettner (/\u02c8le\u026atn\u0259r/, LAYT-n\u0259r; born August 17, 1969) is a retired American basketball player whose Hall of Fame career for the Duke Blue Devils is widely regarded as one of the best in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history. He was the star player on the back-to-back National Championship teams of 1991 and 1992.

{"index": 56, "question": "The series centers around Dora, a seven-year-old Latina girl, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots). Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora's travels, along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, the Spanish language, or counting. Common rituals may involve Dora's encounters with Swiper, a bipedal, anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall-breaking interaction with the viewer. To stop Swiper, Dora must say \"Swiper no swiping\" three times. However, on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people, the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items. Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program's antagonists; the \"Grumpy Old Troll\" dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross, who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer's help. Known for the constant breaking of the fourth-wall depicted in every episode, the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination, normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way. The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale, singing the \"We Did It!\" song with Boots in triumph.\n\n['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Notes', '']\n['1999', 'Entropy', 'Lucas', 'Credited as Zachary Tyler', '']\n['1999-2002', 'Little Bill', 'Andrew Mulligan (voice)', '14 Episodes', '']\n['2000', 'Dora the Explorer', 'Little Red Fish (voice)', 'Episode: \"Fish Out of Water\"', '']\n['2003', 'Marci X', 'Boy', '', '']\n['2004-06', 'The Backyardigans', 'Pablo the Penguin (voice)', '20 Episodes', '']\n['2005-08', 'Avatar: The Last Airbender', 'Aang (voice)', 'Main role; 60 Episodes', '']\n['2005', 'Calling All Engines from Tomorrowland', 'Sailing Around the World', 'Season 1', '']\n['2006', 'The Ant Bully (video game)', 'Lucas Nickle (voice)', 'Video game', '']\n['2006', 'The Ant Bully', 'Lucas Nickle (voice)', '', '']\n['2006', 'Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)', 'Aang (voice)', 'Video game', '']\n['2007', 'Avatar: The Last Airbender \u2013 The Burning Earth', 'Aang (voice)', 'Video game', '']\n['2008', 'Avatar: The Last Airbender \u2013 Into the Inferno', 'Aang (voice)', 'Video game', '']\n\nWhat was the fox called in the film where Zach Tyler Elsen created the voice of Little Red Fish?", "answer": "Swiper"}

Taking Quincy Jones' advice, Legrand worked with the Bergmans to compose \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" and a second song, \"His Eyes, Her Eyes\"; Noel Harrison recorded \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" after Jewison failed to get his friend Andy Williams to do it, while Legrand himself performed \"His Eyes, Her Eyes.\" While the film's score was recorded in Hollywood (featuring, Vincent DeRosa, Bud Shank, Ray Brown and Shelly Manne), the album re-recording issued by United Artists Records on LP was done in France under the composer's baton; Jewison said it was the favourite score for any of his films.\n\n['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Notes']\n['1966', 'A Smell of Honey a Swallow of Brine', 'Lowell Carter', '']\n['1967', 'Hour of the Gun', 'Morgan Earp', '']\n['1968', 'The Thomas Crown Affair', 'Dave', '']\n['1978', 'Big Wednesday', 'Bear', '']\n['1979', 'The Dukes of Hazzard', 'Russell \"Snake\" Harmon', '(Episode: Jude Emery)']\n['1981', 'The Dukes of Hazzard', 'Tommy Dunkirk', '(Episode: The Great Hazzard Hijack)']\n['1984', 'The Dukes of Hazzard', 'Rick', '(Episode: Happy Birthday General Lee)']\n['1988', 'Twice Dead', 'Harry Cates', '']\n['1989', 'Fists of Steel', 'George Breenberg', '']\n['1989', 'Deadly Weapon', 'Sheriff Bartlett', '']\n['1990', 'The Assassin', 'Senator Berkeley', '(final film role)']\n\nWhat is the song from the 1968 film featuring Sam Melville?", "answer": "The Windmills of Your Mind"}
{"index": 82, "question": "A Chewbacca defense is the name in the United States given to a legal strategy in which the aim of the argument seems to be to deliberately confuse the jury rather than to factually refute the case of the other side. This term was used in an episode of the animated series South Park, \"Chef Aid\", which premiered on October 7, 1998. This episode satirized attorney Johnnie Cochran's closing argument defending O. J. Simpson in his murder trial. The term has since been commonly used in describing legal cases, especially criminal ones. The concept of disguising a flaw in one's argument by presenting large amounts of irrelevant information has previously been described as the modern-day equivalent of a red herring or the fallacy ignoratio elenchi (irrelevant conclusion). \"Chef Aid\" is the fourteenth episode in the second season of the American animated television series South Park. The 27th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 7, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and directed by Parker.

{"index": 93, "question": "In Arthurian romance, a number of explanations are given for Arthur's possession of Excalibur. In Robert de Boron's Merlin, the first tale to mention the \"sword in the stone\" motif, Arthur obtained the British throne by pulling a sword from an anvil sitting atop a stone that appeared in a churchyard on Christmas Eve.[note 1] In this account, the act could not be performed except by \"the true king,\" meaning the divinely appointed king or true heir of Uther Pendragon. This sword is thought by many to be the famous Excalibur, and its identity is made explicit in the later Prose Merlin, part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle. This version also appears in the 1938 Arthurian novel The Sword in the Stone by British author T. H. White, and the Disney adaptation. They both quote the line from Thomas Malory in the 15th century; \"Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of this Stone and Anvil, is Rightwise King Born of all England\". The challenge of drawing a sword from a stone also appears in the Arthurian legends of Galahad, whose achievement of the task indicates that he is destined to find the Holy Grail ,\n\n['Equipment', 'in Middle Persian', 'in Persian', 'Notes']\n['Helmet', 'tlg (targ)', '(targ)  (x\u014dd)', '']\n['Gorget', 'glywp\u02ben (gr\u012bwb\u0101n)', '', '']\n['Breastplate / lamellar coat / cuirass', '', '(zirih)', '']\n['Chain mail shirt / Hauberk', '', '(jaw\u0161an)', '']\n['Gauntlets iron-made', '\u02bep\u0304dst (abdast)', '(s\u0101idayn)', '']\n['Girdle', 'kml (kamar)', '(kamar)', '']\n['Leg armor plates as thigh-guards', 'r\u0101n-band', '(r\u0101n-band)', '']\n['Horse armor', 'zyn\u02bep\u0304c\u02bel (z\u0113n-abz\u0101r)', '(z\u012bn-afz\u0101r)  (bargustw\u0101n)', '']\n['Lance (kontos)', '', '(nayza)', '1 each.']\n['Sword', '\u0161m\u0161yl (\u0161am\u0161\u0113r)', '(\u0161am\u0161\u0113r)', '1 each.']\n['Shield', 'spl (spar)', '(sipar)', '1 each.']\n['Battle axe', '', '(tabarz\u012bn)', '']\n['Mace', 'wlz (warz wazr) gt (gad)', '(gurz)  (am\u016bd)', '']\n['Bow case', '', '(kam\u0101n-d\u0101n)', '']\n['Bows (with bowstrings)', 'km\u02ben (kam\u0101n)', '(kam\u0101n)', '2 each.']\n['Quiver', 'kntgl (kantigr)', '(t\u012br-d\u0101n)', '']\n['Arrows', 'HTYA (tigr)', '(t\u012br)', '30 each.']\n['Bowstrings (spare)', 'zyh (z\u012bh)', '(zih)', '2 each.

{"index": 117, "question": "Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet  meme that emerged in the early 2010s. The music typically features a fascination with 1980s and 1990s styles of mood music such as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, often sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects. The subculture surrounding vaporwave is often associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, glitch art, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.

Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina takes the baby to the king, in the hopes that the sight of the child will soften his heart. He grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in a desolate place. Cleomenes and Dion return from Delphos with word from the Oracle and find Hermione publicly and humiliatingly put on trial before the king. She asserts her innocence, and asks for the word of the Oracle to be read before the court. The Oracle states categorically that Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, Camillo is an honest man, and that Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. Leontes shuns the news, refusing to believe it as the truth. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes' son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. At this, Hermione falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband.

In his first appearance, he flirts with Meredith Grey, and Derek punches him in the face. Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife, Addison (Kate Walsh) while they were living in New York. Mark travels to Seattle, intent on convincing Addison to return with him, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship. Mark returns during season three at Addison's drunken behest, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred, Mark sells his successful private practice (which he previously shared with Derek) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During Meredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek's friendship back. It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek's sisters. Mark has a brief fling with Addison's friend, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and develops a friendship with Derek's girlfriend, intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). It is revealed that after Derek left New York, Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months, during which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time, Addison will give their relationship another chance. Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles.\n\n['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Notes']\n['2015', 'Leo & Clark', 'Leo', 'Short film']\n['2015', \"Grey's Anatomy\", 'Kamal', '1 episode']\n['2016', 'Lab Rats: Elite Force', 'AJ', '2 episodes']\n['2017', 'Adam Ruins Everything', 'Stuart', '1 episode']\n['2017', 'Mr. Robot', 'Mohammed', '1 episode']\n['2018', 'Alex Inc.', 'Ben Schuman', '10 episodes']\n['2018', 'American Vandal', 'Myles Crimmins', '3 episodes']\n['2018', 'The Sinner', 'Julian Walker', 'Lead role season 2']\n['2018', 'Future World', 'Grandson', '']\n['2019', 'Ramy', 'Young Ramy', '1 episode']\n\nIn which season does Mark appear in the show where Elisha Henig plays Kamal?", "answer": "season two"}

{"index": 224, "question": "Recitation of the shah\u0101dah is the most common statement of faith for Muslims. In Sunni Islam, it is counted as the first of the Five Pillars of Islam, while the Shi'i Twelvers and Isma'ilis also have the shahada as among their pillars of faith. It is whispered by the father into the ear of a newborn child, and it is whispered into the ear of a dying person. The five canonical daily prayers each include a recitation of the shahada. Recitation of the shahada in front of witnesses is also the first and only formal step in conversion to Islam. This occasion often attracts more than the two required witnesses and sometimes includes a party-like celebration to welcome the convert into their new faith. In accordance with the central importance played by the notion of intention (Arabic: \u0646\u06cc\u0651\u0629\u200e\u200e, niyyah) in Islamic doctrine, the recitation of the shahada must reflect understanding of its import and heartfelt sincerity.

This is an algorithm allowing computers communicating via digital radio in a mesh network to forward messages to computers that are out of reach of direct radio contact.

{"index": 243, "question": "Matthews was drafted by the Browns out of the University of Southern California with the 12th pick in the first round of the 1978 NFL Draft. Clay was a four-time Pro Bowler for Cleveland and was a cornerstone of the defense for well over a decade. In 1984, Clay recorded 12.0 sacks. He was present at the infamous Browns playoff losses known as Red Right 88, The Drive, and The Fumble, that kept some very good teams from appearing in a Super Bowl. One of his most memorable moments as a Brown was in a playoff game against the Bills on January 6, 1990. Jim Kelly and the high flying Bills offense came to Cleveland for a memorable shootout. With only seconds left in the 4th quarter and clinging to a 34-30 lead, Matthews intercepted a Kelly pass on the Brown's two yard line to seal a Cleveland victory. After the 1993 season, Clay became an Atlanta Falcon. In 1995 at the age of 39, Matthews started all 16 games for the Falcons. He was also the oldest player to record a sack at 40 years, 282 days.

{"index": 280, "question": "The 2016\u201317 Danish Superliga season is the 27th season of the Danish Superliga, which decides the Danish football championship. The season is the first with a new league structure in which 14 clubs play each other home and away, until the league is split up in championship and relegation play-offs. The new structure is inspired by the one used by the Belgian First Division A and was approved by the Danish FA, Dansk Boldspil-Union, on 28 June 2015. The 2016\u201317 Danish Cup was the 63rd season of the Danish Cup competition. F.C. Copenhagen won the tournament, earning qualification into the second qualifying round of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League.  However, as F.C. Copenhagen also won the 2016\u201317 Danish Superliga, Br\u00f8ndby IF, the cup runners-up, is allotted that position in the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League.\n\n['Place', 'Team', 'Record',

{"index": 285, "question": "While references to verify the manufacturers' claims have been included, there is always the possibility of inaccuracy or hyperbole. Also note that a single vehicle can be sold concurrently under several nameplates in different markets, as with for example the Nissan Sunny; in such circumstances manufacturers often provide only cumulative units sold figures for all models. As a result, there is no definitive standard for measuring units sold; Volkswagen has claimed its Beetle as the bestselling car in history as it did not substantially change throughout its production run. By contrast, Toyota has applied the Corolla nameplate to 11 generations since 1966, which have sold over 40\u00a0million through July 2013.\n\n['Wins', 'Manufacturer']\n['17', 'Ford']\n['9', 'Subaru']\n['4', 'Opel']\n['4', 'Toyota']\n['3', 'Mini']\n['3', 'Mitsubishi']\n['3', 'Vauxhall']\n['3', 'Renault']\n['2', 'Triumph']\n\nDoes Mitsubishi or the top selling brand of cars have fewer wins among the manufacturers who are associated with multiple winners of the Rally Isle of Man?", "answer": "Mitsubishi"}

{"index": 300, "question": "Bob Goalby won his only major championship, one stroke ahead of Roberto De Vicenzo, the reigning British Open champion. On the back nine in the final round, Goalby birdied 13 and 14 and eagled 15 to record a 66 (\u22126) and a total of 277 (\u221211). At first it appeared that he had tied De Vicenzo and the two would meet in an 18-hole Monday playoff, but De Vicenzo returned an incorrect scorecard showing a par 4 on the 17th hole, instead of a birdie 3, sunk with a two-foot putt. Playing partner Tommy Aaron incorrectly marked the 4 and De Vicenzo failed to catch the mistake and signed the scorecard. USGA rules stated that the higher written score signed by a golfer on his card must stand, and the error gave Goalby the championship. Ironically, Goalby discovered a scoring error he had made on the card he was keeping for Raymond Floyd, his playing partner in the final round, which he corrected at the scorer's tent. He had marked Floyd down for a par-3 on the 16th hole, when Floyd had actually bogeyed the hole. Floyd ended up in a tie for seventh place with, among others, Aaron.

{"index": 307, "question": "\"Wake Me Up\" (stylised as \"WAKE ME UP!\") is a song by Swedish DJ and electronic music producer Avicii, released as the lead single from his debut studio album True, released on CD and cassette by PRMD Music, Lava Records and Sony Music's Columbia Records on June 17, 2013. American soul singer Aloe Blacc provides vocals for the track and Mike Einziger of Incubus provides acoustic guitar. Avicii introduced \"Wake Me Up!\" for the first time live on stage at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The experimental rendering (it was accompanied by a live band with instruments and vocalists, including Blacc, Einziger and Incubus members Ben Kenney on bass and Jos\u00e9 Pasillas on drums) reportedly confused and angered a section of the electronic dance festival community. Subsequently, Avicii achieved critical and commercial success with the release of the single worldwide. Michael Aaron \"Mike\" Einziger (born June 21, 1976) is an American musician, best known as the guitarist and co-songwriter of the rock band Incubus. Einziger is widely known as an innovator and enthusiast of the use of pedalboard guitar effects during live concerts, and was voted #41 in Total Guitar's top 100 guitarists of all time in 2002. In an interview with Gibson Guitars, writer Steven Rosen states \"[Einziger] hasn\u2019t played the guitar so much as he has manipulated it, submitted it to his own needs. Einziger fashions a sonic tapestry that draws heavily from the Zappa/Vai/Hendrix school of rock.\" Mike is also an active composer, writing his first full-scale orchestral concert entitled \"End.>vacuum\", as well as \"Forced Curvature of Reflective Surfaces\"; an experimental composition that was featured at the \"West Coast, Left Coast\" Festival at Walt Disney Concert Hall. He co-wrote and played acoustic guitar on Avicii's 2013 worldwide hit \"Wake Me Up\".

William Randolph Hearst Sr. (/h\u025c\u02d0st/; April 29, 1863 \u2013 August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. Moving to New York City, he acquired The New York Journal and fought a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World that sold papers by giant headlines over lurid stories featuring crime, corruption, graphics, sex, and innuendo.  Acquiring more newspapers, Hearst created a chain that numbered nearly thirty papers in major American cities at its peak. He later expanded to magazines, creating the largest newspaper and magazine business in the world.\n\n['Publication', 'Year of launch', 'Current owner']\n['Inside Soap', '1992', 'Hearst Magazines UK']\n['Heat', '1999', 'H.

{"index": 313, "question": "Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant,[a] April 27, 1822 \u2013 July 23, 1885) was a prominent United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General at the conclusion of that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship and civil rights, implement reconstruction and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a difficult job during the early post Civil War era.\n\n['Actor', 'Role']\n['Chris Sarandon', 'Jacque Marchant']\n['Frank Langella', 'Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi']\n['Carrie Fisher', 'Emma Lazarus']\n['Dana Delany', 'Moya Trevor']\n['Corinne Touzet', 'Jeanne Baheau']\n['George Kennedy', 'Seamus Reilly']\n['Claire Bloom', 'Madame Bartholdi']\n['LeVar Burton', 'Robert Johnson']\n['Jean-Pierre Cassel', '\u00c9douard de Laboulaye']\n['Remak Ramsay', 'John La Farge']\n['Philip Bosco', 'Boss William Tweed']\n['Alan North', 'Ulysses S.

It was released in North America on October 26, 2010, and in Europe on November 5, 2010. It is published by Disney Interactive Studios and developed by Page 44 Studios. Phineas and Ferb is an American animated musical comedy television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas Flynn and his British stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and Phineas' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to Ferb's father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the b-plot almost always features Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus Perry the Platypus working as a spy (\"Agent P\") for OWCA (the Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to defeat the latest scheme of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, a mad scientist driven largely by a need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother.
